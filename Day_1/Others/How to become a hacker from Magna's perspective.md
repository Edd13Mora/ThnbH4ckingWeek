# how to become a hacker:
![Untitled](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp4285511.jpg)
Hey, Im magna and i am an absolute noob, i just started my cybersecurity journey one day ago. So how is a noob going to tell you how to become a hacker ?

## How it all started:
Lets start from the beginning. I "Magna" was always obsessed with computers as all of you probably are and were, i loved opening them and discovering all the parts they contained. So i started learning Html and Css until I've reached an intermediate level and then started losing interest, so i stopped studying it.

## how did i learn about cybersecurity :
One day as i was working in an electronic repair chop in "Derb Ghalef" i saw a cd disc that contained a program called wifi slax that I've already heard of, so of course I've bought it and tried to learn how to use it for days and found out how passionate i was by discovering all it's features. I've felt really powerful but was scared so I've asked my father about what to do next. He told me that it was a powerful tool and he believed I still was not ready to use such a thing (i was 12 or 13 at the time), and he asked me to do what i believed was best so I've destroyed it XD. But i promised my self that one day i will learn how to hack.
Fast forward to two years ago when I've heard again about cybersecurity. My first reaction was ro search how to start learning it. Spoiler alert : it took me two years to do it :/
To be honest I've had multiple attempts of starting. I started by learning Python and then bought a cybersecurity course and started it but couldn't finish it because I've found it soo boring, then started learning java and stopped because i had to prepare for some exams. And then started learning about networking and stopped again. 

Why have i done nothing about it this last two years ? The answer that i've tried to convince my self (unconsciously) that i didn't have the resources at first, than that i didn't have a powerful computer and that i didn't have the time because of my studies. 
But those were never the real problems.


## What was the real problem ?
I discovered that the problems were not that i wasn't motivated or that i didn't have time, the problem was that i lacked self respect. I was afraid of losing, i was afraid of starting from the wrong place or moving in the wrong direction. I always knew the solution but life had to give me a lot of hard times to teach me how to actually start. 

So the answer of the principle question of this article is :
 Just start hacking 




## What about my present situation? 

Now i have that feeling, the special one, the feeling of being in love. I Have the same feeling as finding the women of your life that makes you happy and exited every time you see her face. I don't know if im over reacting or that this is only the excitement of the beginning or if im going to get board after a little bit of time. But the difference right now is that I've learned a key lesson, to be able to keep going you need a community or friend that support and help you and that you need to support and help to be able to continue your journey, you always need to give back to the community.

I want you guys to treat me like a newborn that still don't know anything about the world and has the fire in him to learn.

I want this article to be the testimony of my will to hack the world (ethically of course).
PS: I've wrote this article on a train ride to prove to my self that i should stop giving my self excuses. 

Happy hacking,

Magna's out.
