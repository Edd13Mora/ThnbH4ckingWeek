## Introduction

* Keyloggers is an archaic method used by malware authors its basically record everything you type on a keyboard.

## Deep analysis

* the API we are hacking is ```GetAsyncKeyState``` , its one of the most common APIs that used by Keyloggers ,it Determines whether a key is up or down at the time the function is called ,it takes ```int``` in arguments, and returns ```SHORT```

* as you can see  ```GetAsyncKeyState``` is just a wrapper around  ```ntUserGetAsyncKeyState```

 * ```ntUserGetAsyncKeyState```

* if you perform a ```GetAsyncKeyState``` the execution will be like this :

     ### Notes
   * The real code of ```ntUserGetAsyncKeyState``` function runs in Kernel Mode.
   * When a user-mode application calls the Nt or Zw version of a native system services routine, the routine always treats the parameters that it receives as values that come from a user-mode source that is not trusted .
  
## Patching GetAsyncKeyState :
 
 * first thing we do is locate ```GetAsyncKeyState``` in memory then we overwrite the first 12 bytes and make it jump to our fake function .

 * if the specified key is down/pressed ```GetAsyncKeyState``` returns 0x8001 or -32767 in decimal to abuse it ,we create an array of characters of our choice and return -32767 in every character so the keylogger log it sequentially ,then we returns 0 everytime ```GetAsyncKeyState``` get called so the keylogger get blocked from logging .
  
      ```C
      unsigned char	msg[] = {
      'T','R','O','L','L','E','D'
      };
    ```

 * our function in memory:

### Lastly

* im planning to make a highly effective program that detect all ( high/low ) level and both direct/indirect syscalls keyloggers and shut them down .
