# Story

So I was in the office working and I heard the developers team, talking about programming and how it's good, how it feels when you are stuck on something hard to code, and the adrenalin you feel when you solve it!
Then I decided to give them a simple challenge and give **500$** to the winner.

## The challenge
I want you to make for me, an HTML page that embeds   an MP4 file(Video) from the local storage, so when I open the HTML page, the video needs to be played automatically with voice and without any user interaction, You can use Javascript if you want =)
You have 3 days to do it!

## Reaction of the players

So they Understood the challenge and they said, Woooah its easy we will do it in 30 min

## What happening ?

This was the question everyone asked himself, why I'm not able to make this?
Some of them have already done it before but now it looks hard to make it!
Also, some of them succeded to get the video autoplay but without voice :3

# What was that challenge ?

So basically this challenge was impossible, else if you can find a 0day in one of the known browsers like Chrome...
I know that you may be confused now, and maybe you will also try to solve it, but believe me you will not make it

## Why?

Because Chrome's autoplay policies changed in April of 2018 and I'm here to tell you why and how this affects video playback with sound. Spoiler alert: users are going to love it!
As you may have [noticed](https://webkit.org/blog/7734/auto-play-policy-changes-for-macos/), web browsers are moving towards stricter autoplay policies in order to improve the user experience, minimize incentives to install ad blockers, and reduce data consumption on expensive and/or constrained networks. These changes are intended to give greater control of playback to users and to benefit publishers with legitimate use cases.
Chrome's autoplay policies are simple:

 - Muted autoplay is always allowed.
 - Autoplay with sound is allowed if:
		 -   The user has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).
		 -   On desktop, the user's  [Media Engagement Index](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#media-engagement-index)  threshold has been crossed, meaning the user has previously played video with sound.
		-   The user has  [added the site to their home screen](https://web.dev/customize-install/)  on mobile or  [installed the PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)  on desktop.
