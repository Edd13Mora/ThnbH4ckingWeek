# Story

So I was in the office working and I heard the developers team, talking about programming and how its good, how it feels when you stuck on something hard to code and the adrenalin you feel when you solve it!
Then I decided to give them a simple challenge and give **500$** to the winner.

## The challenge

I want you to make for me, an HTML page that embed  .MP4 file(Video) from the local storage, so when I open the HTML page, the video needs to be played automaticaly with voice and without any user interaction, You can use Java script if you want =)
You have 3 days to do it!

## Reaction of the players

## Why?

Because Chrome's autoplay policies changed in April of 2018 and I'm here to tell you why and how this affects video playback with sound. Spoiler alert: users are going to love it!
As you may have [noticed](https://webkit.org/blog/7734/auto-play-policy-changes-for-macos/), web browsers are moving towards stricter autoplay policies in order to improve the user experience, minimize incentives to install ad blockers, and reduce data consumption on expensive and/or constrained networks. These changes are intended to give greater control of playback to users and to benefit publishers with legitimate use cases.
Chrome's autoplay policies are simple:

 - Muted autoplay is always allowed.
 - Autoplay with sound is allowed if:
		 -   The user has interacted with the domain (click, tap, etc.).
		 -   On desktop, the user's  [Media Engagement Index](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#media-engagement-index)  threshold has been crossed, meaning the user has previously played video with sound.
		-   The user has  [added the site to their home screen](https://web.dev/customize-install/)  on mobile or  [installed the PWA](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/)  on desktop.
