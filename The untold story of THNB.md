Everything started when ***Eddie*** was young, it was high school and IT was something new in Morocco, having a personal computer at that time was something impossible for him, no one in the family will support the idea of having a computer cause they believe he will not focus on his studies, and it was really expansive too.

***Eddie*** used to play Playstation2 in public cyberspace, but he always wanted to touch the computers cause he thought PlayStation is for games but computers are made for something more interesting…

Enjoying playing **MetalSlug** and **GodOfWare** with a joystick, but always wanted to touch a keyboard, to use the mouse and see how it feels, but never had the courage or the money to try it.

He was scared to break the computer since he had no idea how it works, and no one ever gave him the opportunity to try.

It was a sad period till the new school season started, and guess what! Eddie will have a computer science class, no one can imagine his feeling when he knew that he finally will touch a computer.

Unfortunately, this was a daydream, the IT course was only 2 hours per month, and the teacher didn’t care if there was a student that never had a computer before, so he directly jumped to work with something called Microsoft office!

Woah ***Eddie*** was confused, especially because there were some classmates that already have personal computers in their houses so they look like having superpowers.

It was sad, but not enough to make him sound, one day one of his classmates was talking with the teacher about something called Hacking and that his big brother is a hacker and he can do some magical things with his computer, like controlling other computers remotely.

This was too loud to be understood, Eddie was right this machine is not like the Playstation, it's something bigger, it is like a portal that can take you to other dimensions…


***Eddie*** had no friends, only his father so he started telling him about his love for something called a computer, and will love to have one maybe in the future …

Days and weeks passed, and one night ***Eddie*** was outside playing with some neighbours, suddenly he heard someone calling him to go back home, cause his father is looking for him.

Well if you're Morrocan you will certainly that moment when it's late and, you are still outside so parents will rebuke you when you back, this is what ***Eddie*** felt when he was backing home.

But the sweet reality was so different, on this night his father gifted him his first computer ever!

And from this moment Mr reader, you will start feeling the butterfly effect of all of this.

***Eddie*** learned how to use his computer and ******started using his computer and searching for how to be a Hacker, how to have the magical power the do unbelievable things, searching a lot on forums and wiki pages, and even asked people from high school who already had the computers for years but no one wanted to help or tell him from where to start, even family no one believed when they hear him saying I wanna be a **Hacker.**

Some of them said this only can happen in films so forget about it.

***Eddie*** understood that his environment is toxic and he will never grow up while living mentally inside it, so he started learning English in order to start searching using it and maybe find people and articles that can help him…

After 10 years with a lot of hard work and fighting, ***Eddie*** becomes a professional Hacker and moved to live in Europe but kept in contact with his best online hackers friends [***0xPwny***, ***Jakom,*** and ***C3poDay***].

A year ago, ***Eddie*** had a new idea that he shared with his friends in order to collaborate with them, it was the start of ***The Hacker News B’darija,*** a project that will regroup the whole community of Moroccan hackers in order to help each other for free.
