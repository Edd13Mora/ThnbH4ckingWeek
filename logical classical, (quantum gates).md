# hi i will talk about logical (classical, quatum) gates

## 1st classical [AND/OR/XOR/NOT/NAND/NOR/XNOR]

everyone know the brain of computer its the processor and the processor composed from transistors (managed as logical gates not randomly)
well you can know what logic gates do by the name
ther is some pics and the truth tables (you know)

db rah les transistors mamhtotinch randomly f process mhtotine 3La chkel logical gates mhm rah t9ed te3ref dawra d kola wehd rir men name
check ltehet some pics and truth table ze3ma rak fahem

(1/0) mean that ther is electrical charge or not

```
NOTE : THE LOGICAL GATES SHEMA NOT LIKE IN THE IMG ON REAL LIFE THE LOGICAL GATES LIKE CHIPSETS WITH PINS
```
## 2nd quatum [PX/PY/PZ/H/SP/T/CNOT/CX/CZ/SWAP.........]

```
DISCLAMER : IF YOU DONT HAVE A MEDUIM LEVEL ON MATH/PC DONT CHECK THE PIC BUT YOU CAN READ I DIDNT TALK WITH SCIENTIST EXPRESSION FOR YOUR WELL
TAHDIR : ILA ILA MAKANCH 3ENDEK LEVEL CHWYA MZN F MATH/PC BLA MATCHOUF LES PIC WLKN T9ED TKEMEL L9ARAYA HIT MAKHDEMTX B EXPRESSION METHAMTIQUE 3LA WED SEHTEK 
```

listen i will talk about a real magic so normaly we know that classical logical gates can the output be 1 or 0 nothing else but in the **** of quatum
the ouput can be 1 or 0 or 1 and 0 in the same time if you didnt understand that i can tell you to read about quatum theory because its complex af
anyway ther is a pic,truth table for some qgates

sme3 db mzn rah randwi 3la sihr db normalement classical gate radi y3tik ouput bjouj ihtimalate 1 wla 0 wlkn f quantum lihtimalate likaynin 1 wla 0 wla 1/0 fde9a wehda
ila mafhmtich kanshek te9ra 3La quantum theory raha m3e9da bzf 
mhm hahya pic 3la qgates okeh
